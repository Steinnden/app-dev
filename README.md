The **Lord of the Rings** is a trilogy of epic fantasy adventure films directed by Peter Jackson, based on the novel The Lord of the Rings by English author **J. R. R. Tolkien**. The films are titled identically to the three volumes of the novel: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002), and The Return of the King (2003).

One of my favorite moments in the film trilogy is the the Invasion of Rohan led by Saruman, who, seeking power, sends his orc army to conquer the kingdom. Saruman’s forces ravage Rohan, weakening its defenses and its people. However, with the help of Gandalf, King Théoden breaks free from Saruman’s manipulation and rallies his people. The pivotal Battle of Helm’s Deep sees the Rohirrim, aided by allies like Aragorn and Gandalf, defend their stronghold against overwhelming odds. The arrival of reinforcements turns the tide, and Saruman’s invasion is defeated. The event highlights themes of courage, unity, and hope in the face of evil.
